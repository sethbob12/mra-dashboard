# MRA Dashboard Data Schema

This document describes the JSON data schema powering the MRA Dashboard. The dashboard uses three main data sources:

1. **FLData (MRA Data)**
2. **QAData (Quality Assurance Data)**
3. **FeedbackData (Reviewer Feedback Data)**

Each sectionâ€™s schema is provided below with the JSON definition followed by explanations of each field.

---

## 1. FLData.js Schema

This section stores information for frontline reviewers. It includes basic reviewer details, client associations, cost per case information, and an array of performance snapshots.

Explanations for above data points:
id - Unique identifier for each QA record (for API operations)
qaMember - Numeric identifier for the QA member. // Was used for testing but probably should be name
name - The QA member's name.
totalCasesSubmitted - Total number of cases the QA member has submitted. //Count triggered by use of the 'submit 100%' or 'submit for further review' buttons
breakdownByClient - An object showing the number of cases QAd per client // all clients should be listed out here
casesPast7Days - Number of cases handled in the past 7 days.
casesPast30Days - Number of cases handled in the past 30 days.
casesPast60Days - Number of cases handled in the past 60 days.
revisionsSentWeek - Number of revisions sent in the past week.
revisionsSentMonth - Number of revisions sent in the past month.
clientRevisionsWeek - Number of client-driven revisions in the past week. // These are cases submitted by the QA member which later come back for 'revision'. 'Revision' here also needs defined, possibly with a time component (within 72-96 hours).
avgCasesDay - Average number of cases processed per day.
prevAvgCasesDay - Previous period's average cases per day.
prevCasesPast7Days - Number of cases in the previous 7-day period.

prevTotalCases - Total cases count in the previous period (typically a 7-day period).
prevRevisionsSentWeek - Number of revisions sent in the previous week.
prevClientRevisionsWeek - Number of client revisions in the previous week.
feedback - An array of feedback objects:
   content - The feedback text.
   reviewer - The name of the reviewer (MRA) who received the feedback.
   client - The client associated with the case feedback.
   caseID - The identifier for the case. // This allows the specific case to be located on the platform without having any PHI on the dashboard
   date - The date and time when the feedback was provided (ISO 8601 format). // Needed for sorting and QA metrics section

  ]
}

Explanations for above data points:

id - Unique identifier for each feedback entry (for API operations)
name - The name of the reviewer (MRA) receiving feedback.
feedbackType - The type of feedback, such as "client" or "internal". // client being external; internal being our medical QA team
client - The client associated with this case feedback.
text - The content of the feedback.
date - The date and time when the feedback was given (ISO 8601 format).
caseID - The identifier for the case associated with this feedback (helps locate actual case without exposing PHI on dashboard).
qaMember - Numeric identifier/name for the QA member (included when feedback is internal). // Current architecture requires this field for internal feedback reports to generate under QA Metrics
